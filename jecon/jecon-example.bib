  title        = {Quasi-periodic Fast Propagating Magnetoacoustic Waves during

  journal      = {The Astrophysical Journal},
  abstract     = {Employing Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging
                  Assembly (AIA) multi-wavelength images, we have presented
                  coronal condensations caused by magnetic reconnection between
                  a system of open and closed solar coronal loops. In this
                  Letter, we report the quasi-periodic fast magnetoacoustic
                  waves propagating away from the reconnection region upward
                  across the higher-lying open loops during the reconnection
                  process. On 2012 January 19, reconnection between the
                  higher-lying open loops and lower-lying closed loops took
                  place, and two sets of newly reconnected loops
                  formed. Thereafter, cooling and condensations of coronal
                  plasma occurred in the magnetic dip region of higher-lying
                  open loops. During the reconnection process, disturbances
                  originating from the reconnection region propagate upward
                  across the magnetic dip region of higher-lying loops with the
                  mean speed and mean speed amplitude of 200 and 30 km s−1,
                  respectively. The mean speed of the propagating disturbances
                  decreases from ∼230 km s−1 to ∼150 km s−1 during the coronal
                  condensation process, and then increases to ∼220 km s−1. This
                  temporal evolution of the mean speed anti-correlates with the
                  light curves of the AIA 131 and 304 Å channels that show the
                  cooling and condensation process of coronal
                  plasma. Furthermore, the propagating disturbances appear
                  quasi-periodically with a peak period of 4 minutes. Our
                  results suggest that the disturbances represent the
                  quasi-periodic fast propagating magnetoacoustic (QFPM) waves
                  originating from the magnetic reconnection between coronal
                  loops.}

                  formulation of international trade found in most computable
                  general equilibrium (CGE) models. International trade
                  structures consistent with the monopolistic competition models
                  suggested by Krugman (1980) and Melitz (2003) are presented in
                  a computational setting. The Melitz structure of heterogeneous
                  firms is particularly appealing given its consistency with
                  micro-level findings on firm sizes and export behavior. We
                  broaden the accessibility of these advanced trade theories for
                  CGE modelers, and strengthen the link between contemporary CGE
                  analysis and the broader trade community. Small-scale examples
                  of all three theories (Armington, Krugman and Melitz) are
                  introduced under a unified treatment. This is helpful in
                  translating the advanced theories into an environment that is
                  more familiar to CGE modelers. It is also helpful in showing
                  how the different approaches affect outcomes, in a relatively
                  transparent setting. Moving to an applied setting, we offer
                  our approach to calibration and computation of models that
                  include the Melitz heterogeneous firms structure. Our
                  applications include an analysis of economic integration and
                  subglobal climate policy in a model calibrated to the Global
                  Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) data. We do find that the
                  heterogeneous firms structure matters for conclusions drawn
                  from empirical CGE analysis. In our analysis of economic
                  integration we find endogenous entry leading to important
                  variety effects. We also find important productivity effects
                  related to the competitive selection of more productive
                  firms. In our examination of subglobal climate policy we see
                  substantial trade diversion in the Melitz structure. This
                  exacerbates the problem of carbon leakage and impacts the
                  emissions yields from carbon-based tariffs.}
